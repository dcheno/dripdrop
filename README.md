# DripDrop - A simple BitTorrent Client

DripDrop was written as a project to gain a deeper knowledge of Python. It is not recommended as a client for actual BitTorrent use. At present, the client only downloads files from other peers and does not upload them.

## Running DripDrop
To run DripDrop download the files and use the command line to run dripdrop.py from the root directory:

```
python3 dripdrop.py
```

This will open an interface which will request the name of a .torrent file. This .torrent file should be stored in root directory as well.
